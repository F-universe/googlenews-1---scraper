Google News Scraper
This project is a simple web scraper that allows users to search for articles on Google News and download the content into a text file. It is designed as a basic tool for retrieving information from Google News search results.

How It Works
User Input: The user enters a keyword or phrase to search for on Google News.
Content Download: A separate thread is initiated to download the pages corresponding to the search results.
Saving Results: The scraper saves the content of each page into a text file, including the URL and the extracted text.
Error Handling: If a page cannot be retrieved, an error message is recorded in the file.
Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
bash
Copia codice
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:
bash
Copia codice
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the search interface.
Usage
Enter a keyword or phrase in the search field, click "Search," and the scraper will begin downloading articles from Google News.
The results will be saved in a text file located at C:\Users\fabio\OneDrive\Desktop\googlenews search1\googlenews_search1.txt.
Notes
This is just a foundational project and can be expanded into a much larger tool.
Feel free to copy, modify, and use this project as the starting point for your own developments. The project is designed to be flexible and adaptable for different use cases.
Future Improvements
Adding more complex search parameters (e.g., filtering by date).
Implementing pagination to retrieve more results.
Enhancing the parsing of articles to focus on specific content like headlines or summaries.
This project is meant to serve as a starting point for anyone interested in building web scrapers or expanding it into larger applications. You are encouraged to use this code as you see fit!
